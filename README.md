**Task 1 :**      
creating a game user vs. computer.    
*The game goes like this:* each one in his turn need to change the number in a packet.  
The looser is the one who has only 1 in a packets when the rest are empty.  
In this game the computer always wins.   
Give it a try and see if you can break all odds, and let me know.  

**C_Boggle :**  
*The Boggle game* is our second task in C programming.  
It has a bug - it counts duplicated words - because 5 words could be found using different paths.  

**4 In A Row :**  
*The 4-in-a-row game* is our third task in C programming.  
There are two players - X & O. Every player in his turn decides where to put his mark.  
The winner is the one who has 4 marks sequentially whether it's as a row/column/diagonal.  
If the board is full and no one won - it a tie!
